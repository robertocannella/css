# CSS Grid Poperties and Values
[MDN]()

## ```grid``` value
* The ```grid``` value for ```display``` property on a containing div creates a parent container.
```
.container {
    background: white;
    padding: 10px;
    border: 5px solid black;    
    display: grid;
}
```
The default behavior of the grid value creates a container containing one column and as many rows as there are direct child elements of that container.
